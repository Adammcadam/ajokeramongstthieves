# A Joker Among Theives Mobile First Responsive Website

### What does it do and what need does it fulfill?

My project uses skills learnt to build a responsive and mobile first website for a friend of mines band A Joker Among Theives.
It fulfills the need of the band to have their own website where fans and potential fans can connect to them directly rather via there other social media avenues. It also features the bands current music and the most current music video as well as listing upcoming events and gigs.

### Functionality of the project

My website is fully responsive on both desktop, tablet and other mobile devices. 
The navigation is functional however the contact us page is not yet functional with future plans to make this functional and go to a email address so the band can respond to any messages they receive.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 4
- Bash
- Ubuntu
- Git
- Github
- Google Chrome Developer Tools
- Cloud 9

### Deployment

The website was coded in Cloud 9, a local Git directory was used for version control which was then uploaded to Github using ubuntu/bash. Once in a Github repository it was then made live using Github pages. The website can be found at https://joker-amongst-thieves-adammcadam.c9users.io/index.html

### Testing 

Each page was tested locally and on Github using Google Chrome Developer Tools. This was done to test the functionality of the website and also the look and feel of the page. I tested on Galaxy S6, Pixel 2, iPhone6/7/8, iPad and finally desktop. 
All link were tested as well as all audio and video players.

### What changed after the user design experience (UDX) phase

I had planned on using the bands logo as the header for all my pages however this proved to be too large and cover most of the page before any content was put onto the page so i instead settled for the bands typographic name "A Joker Among Theives", which work much better for the whole user experience. 
I had also planned to use Javascript to enable the user to choose from songs listed however decided to make it easier for the user and split each song. Finally the navigation bar was changed as there was no hint of what page you were on when you click on each navigation item.
